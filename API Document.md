# Introduction:
This document provides the specifications and usage guidelines for the API of a fitness app. This API is designed to allow developers to build integrations with the fitness app, such as connecting the app to wearable devices, tracking workouts, and retrieving user data.

## Authentication:
All API endpoints require authentication via OAuth 2.0. Developers must register their applications with the fitness app to obtain a client ID and secret, which can be used to authenticate API requests. Each user must also authorize the app to access their data via OAuth 2.0.

## Endpoints:

### User Profile
GET /api/v1/profile
Returns the user's profile information, such as name, age, gender, weight, and height.
### Workouts
GET /api/v1/workouts
Returns a list of the user's past workouts, including the workout type, duration, and calories burned.
POST /api/v1/workouts
Creates a new workout for the user, with parameters for workout type, duration, and calories burned.
Nutrition
GET /api/v1/nutrition
Returns the user's daily nutrition summary, including calorie intake, macronutrient breakdown, and meal details.

Response format:
All API responses are returned in JSON format.

Errors:
Errors are returned with an HTTP status code in the 4xx or 5xx range. The response body will contain an error message in JSON format.

Rate Limiting:
The fitness app API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Developers should follow the rate limiting guidelines to avoid being blocked.

Conclusion:
The fitness app API provides a powerful tool for developers to build integrations with the fitness app. Developers should follow the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure their applications function correctly and avoid any potential issues with rate limiting or authentication.
